    <p> The Mystery box is a black box with tubes and the top and bottom. So, our group's black box was similar to the original black box. This is because our box is inconsistent in terms of data and the box can also leak just like the original black box. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The black box is a contraption that has mystery materials used to make water fall from the top of the box to the bottom. When we were initially testing the box we noticed that different amounts of water came out each time. An example is when we put 500 mL in, 335 mL comes out but when we put 500 mL in again 1915 mL comes out. So, knowing about the inconsistencies we wanted to keep that in mind for our own design. Our design was made of tubes and containers.  When the water is poured into the tube  it goes into one bucket and when that bucket fills it goes to the other then it comes out the bottom tube. This creates the same inconsistency that the original box had. So, when we finally tested the box, we had some issues that we had to revise but, when we figured out all the issues we were able to create a box that kind of ran the same way the black box did. </p>
